"# server-side-with-nodejs" 

# Application details 

In the application I just build application for server side where I can collect the data from 
the client side and send the data to the server with **post** request and then 
finally send the data to client side and save the data to a **Database** as well.

Basically It's an application to find the **Geolocation** of the client and send back to the server.

# Technology used 
1. node js
2. express for making the server and making api call
3. NeDB database for storing data
